const bitcoinAPI = new BitcoinAPI({

    token: 'xxcsddfksdjaksld', 
    // required

    baseUrl: 'https://my-bitcoin-api-full-stack-instance-url.com',
    /*
        required: provide your custom base url,
            to be used in combination with
            https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack

## Usage
### .createToken
```.js
(async () => {

    const createTokenResults = await BitcoinAPI.createToken({
               
        baseUrl: 'https://my--bitcoin-api-full-stack-instance.com',
    });

    console.log(
        'Create token results:',
        JSON.stringify( createTokenResults, null, 4  )
    );

    /*
        Logs:

            Create token results: {
                "token": "6bda5fe7949b470fa4e11e..."
            }

        Note:

            unlike the other methods of BitcoinAPI
            .createToken is accessed through the BitcoinAPI class itself,
            not a bitcoinAPI instance of the class
    */
})();
```


### .getTokenInfo
```.js
(async () => {

    const tokenInfo = await bitcoinAPI.getTokenInfo();

    console.log( 'Token Info:', JSON.stringify( tokenInfo, null, 4  ) );

    /*
        Logs:

            Token Info: {
                "isActivated": true,
                "balanceData": {
                    "amount": 0.002,
                    "status": "normal"
                }
            }
    */ 
})();
```


### .createOrGetAddress
```.js
(async () => {

    const addressData = await bitcoinAPI.createOrGetAddress();

    console.log( 'Address Data:', JSON.stringify( addressData, null, 4 ) );
    
    /*

        Logs:

            Address Data: {
                
                "address": "3AfV9QQQTgtCH6YEjBpDTyH5sswgGD5MLp"
            }

        Note:

            createOrGetAddress will return null for the "address" value
                when no fresh addresses are available
    */
})();
```


### .getFeeData
```.js
(async () => {

    const feeData = await bitcoinAPI.getFeeData();

    console.log( 'Fee Data:', JSON.stringify( feeData, null, 4 ) );

            }

        Note:
            This is a public method so it does not

(async () => {

    await bitcoinAPI.withdraw({

        amount: 0.002,

## Requests

### API Url

Use the GitHub code repository [Bitcoin-API-Full-Stack](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack) to create your own Bitcoin API!üë©üèΩ‚Äçüî¨


### Public Endpoints
**Public Endpoints** can be accessed using HTTPS requests with the following header:

```.js
// HTTP header to add to make requests to Public Endpoints
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Tokens
**Tokens** are used to make authorized requests to the Bitcoin-API.io API.
These authorized requests allow you to access
and to control your bitcoin.
A token is a key that gives you access to your bitcoin,
bitcoin addresses, withdraws,
and any other resources associated with that token.
**It is very important that you keep your token
secret and secure in order
to protect your bitcoins
and any token-associated data.**


Tokens are used as follows:
```.js
// HTTP header to add to make requests to Token Endpoints
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Token": "asidasidsdssdfjlkghnkrwthwuyietsahduyrrtjkertg"
}
```


## Resources

### /tokens

#### POST - Create Token
Create a new token.
Tokens provide access to your bitcoins and associated resources
by authorizing token-only requests.


##### Authorization
Public Endpoint


##### Request Body Example
```.js
{}
```

##### Response Body Example
```.js
{
    "token": "asjfhnsdlkjfhdskljhfskdljfhsdjkfsdkjfhnsdlsdf..."
}
```


#### GET - Get Token Info
This endpoint gets info associated with a token.

##### Authorization 
Token Endpoint

##### Response Body Example
```.js
{
    "balanceData": {
        "amount": 0.0005,
        "status": "normal"
    }
}
```

* For the balance data (`body.balanceData`) returned in the response,
there is a `status` value associated with it.
The value will either be `"normal"` or `"transformation"`.
If the value is in the `"transformation"` state, that means a
withdraw is currently being processed.


#### PUT - Update Token Value
This endpoint updates your token's value.
Your old token's value becomes invalid
when you update that token's value.


##### Authorization
Token Endpoint


##### Request Body Example
```.js
{}
```

##### Response Body Example
```.js
{
    "token": "2asjfhnsdlkjfhdskljhfskdljfhsdjkfsdkjfhnsdlsdf..."
}
```


### /addresses

#### POST - Create or Get Bitcoin Address
This endpoint creates a new bitcoin address that can
be used to deposit bitcoins. A new address will be generated
once the old one has bitcoin sent to it.
If the address value is `null`,
there are currently no new addresses available and you
must try again later.


##### Authorization 
Token Endpoint

##### Request Body Example
```.js
{}
```

##### Response Body Example
```.js
{
    "address": "3AfV9QQQTgtCH6YEjBpDTyH5sswgGD5MLp"
}
```

##### More Info:
The balance associated with your token
will be automatically updated after your
bitcoin deposit transaction has
at least 6 confirmations on the bitcoin network.
You can retrieve your bitcoin balance using the
[/tokens GET General-Token Endpoint](#get---get-token-info).


### /fee-data

#### GET - Get Fee Data
This endpoint gets an estimate of the current fee that's
added to the withdraw amount.
**This fee is only used to cover the bitcoin network fees.**


##### Authorization 
Public Endpoint

##### Response Body Example
```.js
{
    "fee": 0.000002
}
```

##### More Info:
This fee estimate is subject
to change according to the bitcoin network.
This fee estimate provides
an estimation of the maximum amount of bitcoin
that will be used by the bitcoin network
to send bitcoin to the desired address.
If the actual fee demanded by
the bitcoin network is less
than the current fee estimate, whatever fee is not used
while performing a withdraw will be refunded shorty
after the withdraw has been performed.

### /withdraws

#### POST - Do Withdraw
This endpoint withdraws bitcoin associated with your token.

##### Authorization 
Token Endpoint

##### Request Body Example
```.js
{
    "amount": 0.00004, // 0.00004 is the min withdraw amount
    "address": "3AfV9QQQTgtCH6YEjBpDTyH5sswgGD5MLp",
    "includeFeeInAmount": false // optional, defaults to false
    "enviroWithdrawAmount": 0.00001 // optional, makes the withdraw an EnviroWithdraw!
}
```

##### Response Body Example
```.js
{}
```

**EnviroWithdraw** - an option that allows you to contribute
bitcoin to our environmentüå≤üå≥üåé!
This donation is added to your withdraw fee.



## Glossary
* **Token Endpoint:** an API endpoint that requires a token set in the request header in order to authorize the request.

* **API:** an application programming interface (API),
in the context of Bitcoin-API,
refers to a collection of access points (called API endpoints) which are used to
access and control your bitcoins.
Check out [this article on bitcoin APIs and regular APIs](https://bitcoin-api.io/articles/bitcoin-api)
for a more detailed explanation of what bitcoin APIs and regular APIs
are and how they function.

* **Endpoint (or API Endpoint):** an endpoint is a url with an
HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST) that can be accessed via HTTPS requests.
Endpoints are the main communication channel of
Bitcoin-API and form the basis for all operations in the API.

* **Public Endpoint:** an API endpoint that is accessible for everyone
without any token authorization required.
See the [Public Endpoint Request](#public-endpoints) section for details on how to make
public endpoint requests.
