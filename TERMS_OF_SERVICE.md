Bitcoin-Api.io Terms of Service
Last Modified: January 17, 2020
PLEASE READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE ENTIRE TERMS OF SERVICE WHEN YOU CLICK "AGREE TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE" OR BY USING BITCOIN-API.IO SERVICES.

1. Abbreviations and Equivalent Terms
The following terms in this document have their abbreviations and their equivalent meanings listed below:

TERMS OF SERVICE: is equivalent to "TOS"
THE USER: is equivalent to "you", the "customer", or your "company" that uses Bitcoin-Api.io services
BITCOIN-API.IO: (in reference to the company, not only to the website) is equivalent to "BA", "us", or "we". Bitcoin-Api.io contains several services including the Bitcoin-Api.io API which is accessed programmatically using computer software, the Bitcoin-Api.io App, and the Api-Bitcoin.io Testnet API and App.
USER ACCOUNT: a user "account" is equivalent to a "token" due to the user account and the token sharing the same underlying data and purpose. The name difference is due to the difference in context, a token is for developers using the API programmatically, user accounts are for app users, although they both use the same technology. A token or a user account is also referred to as "TA" in this document.
2. Customer Agreement
In you using BA services, you are above 18 years of age and are legally allowed in your jurisdiction to make a binding agreement. Also in using BA services, you agree with and are fully capable of fulfilling the terms set forth in this TOS. In the case where these terms are violated, you agree to be liable to us.

3. Scope
The terms set forth in this document are the Terms of Service for Bitcoin-Api.io, an organization subject to Canadian law. The terms apply to any users of BA services, or anybody who accesses BA services in any way, that includes via API, website, VR/AR experience, app, video game console, AI home assistant, or any other relevant technology. The terms apply to anyone regardless if they are paying customers or if they are just accessing the publicly available services.

4. Changes to the Terms of Service
In order to best serve our customers, BA may modify the TOS at any time. If material changes are made to the TOS, you will be notified by email and/or as required by law. The changes will take at least fifteen (15) days to take place unless it is legally necessary for those changes to take place at a sooner or at a later time. The last material update is indicated at the top in the "Last Modified" section. If you do not agree to the updated version, you must cease to use BA as soon as the new TOS is considered valid. By continuing to use BA when the new TOS becomes valid, that indicates that you accept the new TOS and agree to be bound by its terms.

5. Bitcoin-Api.io Tokens and Accounts
To use the core BA services, which includes the ability to receive and to send bitcoin, you must create a token programatically using computer software. From the perspective of the API, a token can be seen as a user account. When you are using other BA services, like the Bitcoin-Api.io App, and you create a user account, that is equivalent to creating a token with the API programatically (they contain the same data and function in the same way). After the token or equivalently the account (the "TA") has been created, verification information is required to be provided. The required information is personally identifiable information that indicates that you are in agreement with the terms set forth in this Bitcoin-Api.io Terms of Service document and in the Bitcoin-Api.io Privacy Policy. The specific information that's required is dependant on the region and time. The information will be requested upon the verification process (see the Privacy Policy for more details on how your data is stored). When the TA has been verified, requests to receive and withdraw bitcoin, and other available operations, can be made.

Whether you are accessing BA services programmatically using the API or using the app to create a user, you will have access to the token itself. The token is what grants access to your bitcoin and your personal information, it is your responsibility for keeping this token secure. If you lose access to your token, please contact support@bitcoin-api.io to lock your token and/or user account to prevent any further actions with that token and/or user account.

6. Privacy Policy
BA uses secure and ethical methodologies in storing and managing your data. Your personally identifiable information will be kept secure and it will not be sold or shared. For more information on how BA manages its data, see the Bitcoin-Api.io Privacy Policy.

7. General Terms
BA is NOT responsible for lost or stolen tokens. This implies BA is NOT responsible for lost or stolen bitcoin as a result of lost or stolen tokens. If there is an issue with BA's system where BA is at fault and bitcoin are lost as a result, then BA will investigate the situation and grant you access to your lost bitcoin as soon as possible (assuming it's proven that BA's system was at fault). Once you receive a token, it is purely your responsibility, BA does not have any access to your tokens, we can only verify if a token is valid or not.

There is a fee in withdrawing bitcoin from Bitcoin-Api.io. That fee is proportional to the bitcoin network and only goes towards the bitcoin network. BA does not make any revenue or profit from the withdraw fee.

BA as a technology company that provides several different internet based services which are constantly evolving. As a result, certain BA technologies may be updated or deleted discontinuing the services provided by those technologies. BA will use its discretion to notify users of any changes in the services.

If you want to remove your token or your account (i.e. your "TA"), that will remove any personally identifiable information associated with it, except for that which is required to be kept by law. Deleting your personally identifiable information can be done programatically through the API, through the app, or through contacting support. If you have any questions about your TA or your personally identifiable information, email support@bitcoin-api.io.
