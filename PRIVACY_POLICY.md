Scope
This is the Privacy Policy of the technology company Bitcoin-Api.io. Bitcoin-Api.io will be referred to in this document as "BA". "You", "your", the "user", or the "customer" will refer to anyone who uses BA services. This Privacy Policy describes how BA handles your data and personally identifiable information when using BA technology including the Bitcoin-Api.io website, the Api-Bitcoin.io bitcoin testnet website, or any API or service provided by BA.

The purpose of this policy is to explain how BA gathers and uses data in a way that's compliant with international regulations and how the data managed by BA is secure for its customers.

Acceptance of Privacy Policy
In using the services provided by BA, you are in agreement with the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to or are unable to agree to the Privacy Policy, you should cease to use BA and its services immediately.

Changes to the Privacy Policy
The Privacy Policy of BA can be modified at any time. When modified, the "last modified" date at the top of this Privacy Policy will be updated. If there are any material changes to the Privacy Policy, you will be notified by email or as required by law.

Data Collection and Usage
In order for BA to provide its services, data is required to be collected and used in various ways. Specifically below is the data that is collected by BA and how it's used:

Your IP address - in order to use the basic services provided by BA, your IP address is collected and is stored when creating an account. Further usage of this account will be tied to the initial sign-up data. Only you have access to your account data.

Your email address - you can optionally tie your email address to your account to provide an extra layer of access control and security. Your account data is only accessible to you.

For further compliance needs, BA can accept other personal information including but not limited to name, phone number, address, and government issued personal identification documents. This information may be needed to comply with regulations and will not be shared with anyone else without consent from the provider of the information. This information will only be requested upon necessity (e.g. court order) and will not normally be requested.

Your usage data, including bitcoin deposited, withdrawn and transacted. This also includes other information such as account usage data. This data is kept private to you although it may be anonymized and inspected in order to improve BA security and overall quality.

Anonymized usage data and statistics will be collected. This is a transformed version of BA data with any personally identifiable information removed. This is used to improve BA security and quality. Note, as explained in more depth in the "Data Sharing" section, any personally identifiable information will not be shared with any third parties unless under criminal investigation or unless consent has been given.

Any volunteered information, or information volunteered after requested from BA is subject the terms of the Privacy Policy.

Data Sharing
In order to provide and maintain BA services, your data may be shared with law enforcement or other third parties upon necessity. It should also be noted that BA being a company that works with bitcoin, bitcoin transactions, and the bitcoin network, some of the data such as bitcoin addresses and bitcoin transactions will be publicly viewable through the bitcoin network. Below is a summary of what data is shared by BA:

Your data will be shared with third party service providers that are used as a basis for BA. For example, BA uses Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Services to manage BA data. Any third party service provider used will be properly vetted to ensure any shared data is being handled in an appropriate manner. Your personally identifiable information will not be sold to any third party service providers.

In the case of suspected fraud or other illegal activity happening while using BA services, BA may share relevant data with legal authorities upon request.

Your information may be shared with other BA users in the case of suspicious or illegal activity in order to prevent any further problematic activity.

Your anonymized third party information may be shared with third party services for analysis in order to improve BA security and services.

Any other provided or volunteered information where consent has been given for it to be shared.

Data Protection
BA uses secure digital and procedural methodologies in order to keep your data and your bitcoin as secure as possible. In order to keep your data and your bitcoin secure, BA security is based on highly secure existing cloud infrastructure including AWS and Google Cloud. In addition, Bitcoin-Api.io DOES NOT store large volumes of Bitcoin. The BA services themselves only contain purposefully minute amounts of bitcoin that are needed for the business computer operation logic.

Data Retention and Access
BA uses accounts that can store personally identifiable information associated with them. Transactions and other user actions associated with those accounts will be stored indefinitely although the personally identifiable information associated with those accounts and actions are not necessarily stored indefinitely, depending upon user request. Personally identifiable information stored with BA can be deleted at any time except for any data which is required to be kept by law.

If you require access to specific data or have a request to delete certain data, you can contact support at support@bitcoin-api.io.

Third-Party Links
BA may have links to third-party websites and other internet based services that are not managed or are affiliated with BA. BA is not responsible for any data shared or any other interaction and any resulting consequences of those actions on those third-party entities. Please refer to those companies' own terms and privacy policies in order to understand how those companies deal with your data and your privacy while using their services.

Age Restrictions
BA is not intended for use by anyone that is under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18 or are using BA for someone else who is under the age of 18, you are in violation of the Privacy Policy and you must cease to use BA services immediately.
